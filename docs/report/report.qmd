# Introduction

_Fraud Detection using Machine Learning (Oza, 2018)_ proposed a class weight strategy to tackle the problem of imbalanced classes in payments fraud detection. The author showed that choosing a suitable class weight in a classifier can be sufficient to flag fraud detections with a reasonably low false positive rate whilst maintaining high accuracy.
